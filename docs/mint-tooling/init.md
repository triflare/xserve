# Initializing a Project

If you have forked Mint to use as the toolchain for your own extension, `npm run init` helps you replace the template placeholder values with your own details in one shot.

## What it does

The `init` script walks you through a short interactive prompt, then makes the following changes:

- **Replaces `src/`**: `scaffoldTemplate()` deletes the existing `src/` directory and copies the template into a new `src/` (init replaces `src/` by deleting the existing `src/` directory and copying the template into a new `src/`).
- Updates `package.json` with your package name, description, author, and version.
- Writes a fresh `src/manifest.json` with your extension's metadata.
- Prepends an initialization comment header to `src/01-core.js`.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Running `npm run init` (via `scaffoldTemplate()`) will delete and replace your existing `src/` directory. Any uncommitted changes in `src/` will be lost. Rerunning `npm run init` is destructive.

## Running it

```bash
npm run init
```

You will be prompted for:

| Prompt                 | Example value                              | Notes                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Template               | `3` / `operators`                          | Choose by number or template key              |
| npm package name       | `my-cool-extension`                        | Kebab-case, valid npm name                    |
| Extension display name | `My Cool Extension`                        | Shown in Scratch's extension picker           |
| Description            | `Does cool things`                         | Short description                             |
| Author                 | `Jane Doe`                                 | Used in the manifest and build header         |
| Initial version        | `0.1.0`                                    | Must be a valid semver string                 |
| License                | `MIT`                                      | SPDX identifier                               |
| URL                    | `https://github.com/you/my-cool-extension` | Repository or homepage                        |
| Extension id           | `myCoolExtension`                          | camelCase, auto-derived from the display name |

Each prompt shows a default value in parentheses. Press Enter to accept the default.

Template options:

- `blank`
- `sensing-blocks`
- `operators`
- `control-flow`
- `looks`
- `data-storage`
- `advanced`

After you confirm, the script prints a summary of the changes it will make and asks you to type `yes` before proceeding. Anything other than `yes` or `y` aborts without making any changes.

## After initialization

Once `init` finishes:

1. Review `src/manifest.json` and make sure all fields are correct.
2. Confirm `src/01-core.js` now uses your selected extension id and display name in `getInfo()` and includes the initialization header comment.
3. Run `npm run build` to confirm everything builds cleanly.
4. Start adding your own blocks.

## Input validation

The script validates your inputs before making any changes:

- The package name must be a valid npm package name (lowercase, kebab-case, optionally scoped).
- The version must be a valid semver string.
- The extension id must start with a letter and contain only letters and digits (no hyphens, underscores, or spaces).

If any input fails validation the script exits with an error and no files are modified.
